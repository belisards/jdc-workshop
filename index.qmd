## Overview

- What is Quarto?

- Hands-on exercise with Quarto and Github

- A glimpse of other data-driven publication formats

## Quarto 

The state-of-the-art of open-source solutions for publishing data-driven documents.

Easily combine text, code, images, dynamic charts and more.

Go from plain text to reproducible reports, presentations (like this one), dashboards, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.

## How does it look?

Let's see Quarto's main features on its website.

## Some use cases scenarios

- Create reproducible reports for others (and for yourself!)

- Combine with Github to write data analysis reports collaboratively

- Automate the publication of periodic reports using data that changes over time

- Create a report template and automate its application across different data sources

- Create a website for technical documentation

## Working with Quarto documents

Edit Quarto documents using R Studio, Jupyter Notebooks or VS Code.

Render to single files, such as PDF, DOCX and PPT, or use a web-based service to publish Quarto documents.

Github, RPubs Posit (former R Studio Cloud) are common web-based alternatives. 

# Hands-on exercise

## Quarto presentation

First, let's just review how a Quarto document is structured.

1. Visit the GitHub repository [https://github.com/belisards/workshop-jdc](https://github.com/belisards/workshop-jdc)

2. Click on the file `index.qmd`

3. What are your thoughts on this code? Can you intuitively understand how it works? 
         
## Quarto website

Now, we will edit a Quarto document and render it using R Studio.

1. Visit the GitHub repository [https://github.com/belisards/tutorial-ven-migration](https://github.com/belisards/tutorial-ven-migration)
2. Click on the file `index.qmd`
3. Is this code similar to the Quarto document for this presentation? Can you spot how R code are integrated in this document?

## Editing a Quarto document

1. Clone the [Github repository](https://github.com/belisards/tutorial-ven-migration) to your local machine
2. In R Studio: click on "File", then "Open Project" and locate the project
3. Render the project
3. Change the data source (line 69) for: `peru_host_mig.csv` or `chile_host_mig.csv` and render the project again
4. Notice how the text rendered automatically changes 

# Other data-driven publication formats

## Geo-based narratives

Leveraging the power of maps to contextualize data.

## Customized stories

Put the readers in the center of your narrative. Useful for comparing hosts and migrants, for instance.
